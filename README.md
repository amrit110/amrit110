###  Hi ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ¤–  I work on engineering problems. Solving them mostly involves programming, and crafting good software. 
Sometimes, I have to use this thing called machine learning.
- ðŸ’©  I'm really trying to avoid using machine learning and solve a problem without it if possible.
- ðŸ˜’  But it turns out I'm having to use them more than I'd like to coz the hard problems that
are still out there seem to need elements of machine learning.
- ðŸ˜„  Thankfully, it involves a lot of programming and math, which I like.
So, we are good so far.
- ðŸ‘»  In my spare time, I like to read, play some football or tennis. I also love movies and hope to write a screenplay someday. We'll see.
